    <!-- To find out which years between 2014 and 2050 have 
        1st January falling on a Sunday, we can use the following approach:
        Loop through each year between 2014 and 2050 and 
        check if the -- 1st January of that year falls on a Sunday--.
        
        To check if the 1st January of a year is a Sunday, 
        we can use the Date object in JavaScript. 
        Create a Date object for the 1st January of each year and 
        use the getDay() method to get the day of the week. 
        The getDay() method returns an integer between 0 and 6, 
        where 0 represents Sunday, 1 represents Monday, and so on.
        If the day of the week is 0 (Sunday), we can print out the year.-->

    <p>
      Write a JavaScript program to find out if 1st January will be a Sunday
      between 2014 and 2050.
    </p>
    <script>
      document.write(`-------------------<br/>`);
      for (let year = 2014; year <= 2050; year++) {
        // Date(year, month, day)
        let day = new Date(year, 0, 1);
        if (day.getDay() === 0) {
          document.write(`1st January is being Sunday ${year} <br/>`);
        }
      }
      document.write("-------------------");
