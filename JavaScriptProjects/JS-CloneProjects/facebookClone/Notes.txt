 OUTLINE: by using outline none will not highlight element on focus 
          but when we use JUST border 0 / none it does highlight the border on focus.

 FLEX-BASIS:
  What is a flex basis?
  Flex-basis is a CSS property used in flexboxes that sets the initial size of a flex item before it grows or shrinks. Flex items exist in flex containers,
  which grow to fill empty space or shrink to prevent overflow on a web page.

** Whenever we use position : sticky then we have to give TOP
