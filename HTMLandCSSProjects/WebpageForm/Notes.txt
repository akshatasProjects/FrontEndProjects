Approach
* The <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
* Inside the form element, provide different options to the user like name, email, age, etc. 
* In HTML, we have different input elements for different tasks. So, we are providing respective input 
types according to the question (email for taking email input, text-area for taking a large message, 
name for taking name input, etc.).
* We have also used the radio-button (let a user selection of the provided choices.), 
  check-button (let a user select zero or more options of the provided choices), 
  and submit-button (the button for submitting the form data to a form-handler).
